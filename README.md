This is a gallery of Art by Sher from the Etsy store utilizing the Etsy API.

Since I have experience with Angular 1, I chose to do this project in Angular 2 because it can't be _that_ different... Right?

This project was seeded by the [Angular2-webpack repo](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack)
